              <li>▢8 ounces flank steak</li>
              (225g, sliced against the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices)

              <li>▢1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
              <li>▢1 tablespoon cornstarch (plus 1/4 cup, divided)</li>
              <li>▢2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
              <li>▢1/4 cup hot water (or hot low sodium chicken or beef stock)</li>
              <li>▢1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce or 1 1/2 tablespoons water and 2 1/2 tablespoons regular soy sauce</li>
              <li>▢1/2 teaspoon ginger (minced)</li>
              <li>▢5 dried red chili peppers (optional)</li>
              <li>▢2 cloves garlic (chopped)</li>
              <li>▢1 tablespoon cornstarch (mixed with 1 tablespoon water to make a slurry)</li>
              <li>▢2 scallions (cut into 1-inch long slices on the diagonal)</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
            <li> Combine the sliced beef with 1 teaspoon oil, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon cornstarch.</li>
            <li>Marinate for 1 hour. The beef should still be quite moist after it has marinated. </li>
            <li>If it looks too dry, add a tablespoon of water to it.</li>
            <li>Next, dredge the marinated beef slices in the remaining 1/4 cup of cornstarch until lightly coated.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix brown sugar and hot water (or low sodium chicken or beef stock) until the sugar is dissolved. </li>
            <li>Mix in 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce. If you don't have low sodium soy sauce, substitute 2 1/2 tablespoons regular soy sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons water. </li>
            <li>The saltiness of various soy sauce brands varies, so give the sauce a taste, and adjust the amounts of sugar/soy sauce/water/stock to your own taste. </li>
            <li>Heat 1/3 cup vegetable oil in the wok over high heat. Just before the oil starts to smoke,</li>
            <li>spread the flank steak pieces evenly in the wok, and sear for 1 minute (depending upon the heat of your wok).</li>
            <li>Turn over and let the other side sear for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Remove to a sheet pan. Tilt it slightly to let the oil drain to one side (lean it on a cookbook or cutting board). </li>
            <li>The beef should be seared with a crusty coating.</li>
            <li>Drain the oil from the wok, leaving 1 tablespoon behind, and turn the heat to medium-high. </li>
            <li>Add the ginger and dried chili peppers, if using. After about 15 seconds, add the garlic. </li>
            <li>Stir for another 10 seconds and add the premixed sauce.</li>
            <li>Let the sauce simmer for about 2 minutes and slowly stir in the cornstarch slurry mixture. </li>
            <li>Cook until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Add the beef and scallions and toss everything together for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>There should be almost no liquid, as the sauce should be clinging to the beef.</li>
            <li>If you still have sauce, increase the heat slightly and stir until thickened.</li>
            <li>Plate and serve with steamed rice!
